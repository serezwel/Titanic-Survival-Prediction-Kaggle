# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Kaggle
This is my submission for the Titanic survival predictor competition from Kaggle.  

The submission is heavily inspired by the Intro to Deep Learning course, including the usage of **Stochastic Gradient Descent** as the prediction model.

A few techniques for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is inspired by another submission for this competition: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/mithun162001/getting-started-with-kaggle)

# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Kaggle
This is my submission for the Titanic survival predictor competition from Kaggle.  

The submission is heavily inspired by the Intro to Deep Learning course, including the usage of **Stochastic Gradient Descent** as the prediction model and **Binary Classification** to predict the results.

A few techniques for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is inspired by another submission for this competition: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/mithun162001/getting-started-with-kaggle)

**DISCLAIMER**: This project does not aim for the best accuracy but as a way to practice machine learning models and data science techniques.


I am still not satisfied with results as of now (16 December 2021), so further updates, especially on data cleaning and feature engineering, to the project will be implemented.
